## Description

Simple app with a background thread used to download images.

## Branches

- 01-asynctask-declaration-starter. It provides a start point just for learning purposes. It includes several TODO comments to guide the development of the changes required to create the code in branch 02-asynctask-declaration.

- 02-asynctask-declaration. It provides the code created to showcase how to declare an AsyncTask class and use it to execute a simple task in the background.
